Pixel Industry Dribbble Widget for WordPress

Description:

This is simple and easy to use WordPress widget plugin developed as part of my job application.
Widget allows you to enter Dribbble username, configurable number of shots to fetch and Dribbble access token. 

When configured, it displays configurable number of latest Dribbble shots for given user on your website.

Notice: There is no caching in place, so it is not suitable to use in production without further modification.

Once plugin is installed, activate it and go to Appearance -> Widgets, find Simple Dribbble Widget and drag it to desired widget area.
